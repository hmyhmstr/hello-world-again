# hello-world-again
I am retaking the tutorial, and hope to commit better (no pun intended) this time around.

Okay, writing about me in the "readme-edits" branch: I am a hamster who was very popular in Ontario in the late 70s/80s. Some people who were kids at that time remember me quite fondly and watch episodes of my show on the YT channel, Retrontario.
